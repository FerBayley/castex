                            Like every company, CHORIZOS CASTEX has its own unique history.  My family emigrated from Europe to Argentina at the beginning of the 19th century.  
                            As we all know, the grill is the centerpiece of the country's gastronomy and culture. I was always a meat lover and especially enjoyed the sausage 
                            that was grilled at my house, in our family roasts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After a while, I decided to look for a better future in the United States and I ended up settling in New York. There was always some nostalgia for 
                            the home I had left, especially the food I grew up with.   Unfortunately, I could not find the same sausages that were eaten at my parents' house.  
                            I then thought that one day, I would look for a way to make the best Argentine-style chorizo in the United States.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That one day finally came and I began to mix the traditional spices with the meat, in order to achieve that perfect blend to make my sausage as 
                            authentic as possible.  Over the next couple of years, I made several attempts at perfecting a recipe but nothing went as I planned.  After the 
                            second year of struggling to making sausages using only a small machine, I finally had the recipe I wanted!  Today, three years after starting my 
                            search, I finally was able to achieve my goal. CHORIZOS CASTEX: I invite you to try the best quality, best tasting Argentine flavored sausages 
                            made here in the USA!
