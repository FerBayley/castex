    <meta name="description" content="Like every company, CHORIZOS CASTEX has its own unique history. My family emigrated from Europe to Argentina at the beginning of the 
    19th century. As we all know, the grill is the centerpiece of the country's gastronomy and culture. I was always a meat lover and especially enjoyed the sausage that 
    was grilled at my house, in our family roasts. After a while, I decided to look for a better future in the United States and I ended up settling in New York. There was 
    always some nostalgia for the home I had left, especially the food I grew up with. Unfortunately, I could not find the same sausages that were eaten at my parents' house. 
    I then thought that one day, I would look for a way to make the best Argentine-style chorizo in the United States. That one day finally came and I began to mix the traditional 
    spices with the meat, in order to achieve that perfect blend to make my sausage as authentic as possible. Over the next couple of years, I made several attempts at perfecting 
    a recipe but nothing went as I planned. After the second year of struggling to making sausages using only a small machine, I finally had the recipe I wanted! Today, three 
    years after starting my search, I finally was able to achieve my goal. CHORIZOS CASTEX: I invite you to try the best quality, best tasting Argentine flavored sausages made 
    here in the USA!. Castex sausage is made with the most noble and best quality raw material, without preservatives, without chemicals, without extra fat, achieving a sausage 
    of extra high quality, unique and that never loses its flavor." />
